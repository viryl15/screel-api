    Dear Screelers,

    We are excited to announce that we have added new features to Screel to enhance your experience and help you connect with other like-minded individuals.

    Some of the new features include:
<b>* {{$feature->title}}</b>
<ul>
    @foreach($feature->content as $ctt)
        <li>{{$ctt['title']}} : {{$ctt['description']}}</li>
    @endforeach
</ul>

    We have also made some improvements to the app's performance and design to make it more user-friendly.

    To access these new features, simply update your Screel app from the browser.

    We hope that you will enjoy these new features and continue to be a part of our community.
    As always, we value your feedback, so please let us know what you think of the new updates.

    Thank you for your support,
    The Screel Team ðŸš€ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
